      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;Wilf Mexted Scenic Reserve is small area of delightful
regenerating native bush which echoes with the sounds of native
birdlife. The cache is located at the lookout, where you can enjoy
views of the Tawa Valley.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;Before the clearance for farming and urban development, native
bush covered the Tawa basin floor and extended to the heights of
Colonial Knob to the West and Mt Roberts to the East. Now near the
foot of Mt Roberts off Woodman Drive, Greenacres, Tawa, is a unique
small part of the original bush preserved through the foresight of
Wilf Mexted as a heritage to all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wilf Mexted was the great grandson of George Mexted who arrived
from England aboard the “Lord William Bentinct” at Petone in May
1841. The Mexted family farmed first at Johnsonville and then in
Takapu Road, Tawa. On his return from the First World War, WIlf
married Dorothy Lawrence of Johnsonville and farmed in Tawa. He
built his farm homestead at what is now 8 Rewa Terrace. He later
moved to Pauatahanui where he farmed for many years. Wilf Mexted
was a great lover of trees and one of his favourite sayings was
“plant a tree for unborn eyes to see”. He gave this bush area to
the people of Tawa in 1939.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We trust those enjoying this gift of nature will help protect
the future of this bush by keeping to the designated track to
prevent damage to the flora.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Source: Signage at Wilf Mexted Scenic Reserve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will most likely lose Satellite reception in the bush, but
follow the path to the lookout where you will regain reception.
Sit, relax, listen to the birdsong, enjoy the view... The signs
suggest the round trip is 25 mins, but that allows for a leisurely
amble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is a 400ml camo snap lock container. When placed, it
contained:&lt;br /&gt;
Log book&lt;br /&gt;

Muggle note&lt;br /&gt;
